# GeoTrail

This project is a React TypeScript application built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and React Router DOM, utilizing React Leaflet for mapping functionalities. The application features an interactive map of Kerala with markers for its districts, a USA state map displaying population density using polygon layers and map showing the current user location along with brief details about the place using external API service. Lazy loading is implemented to optimize the loading performance.
